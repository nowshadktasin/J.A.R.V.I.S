Building the interface for your AI assistant using Lovable.dev involves a step-by-step process primarily driven by natural language interaction. Here's how it's done:

* **1\. Access Lovable.dev**:

  * Go to [Lovable.dev](https://lovable.dev/).   
* **2\. Initiate the Web App Build with a Natural Language Prompt**:

  * Start by explaining your desired web app. The user began by stating: "I want to build a simple and modern web interface to interact with a voice agent using 11 labs".  
  * The prompt I used:

  “I want to build a simple and modern web interface to interact with a voice agent using

  ElevenLabs. The interface should feel sleek, futuristic, and minimalistic—think clean UI with a 'techy' aesthetic, avoiding unnecessary clutter.

  The voice agent is named J.A.R.V.I.S, and users should be able to send voice inputs to the system.

  The spoken input should be transcribed and sent to a webhook endpoint. Once the webhook processes the request, the response should be displayed in the interface, ideally as a message from Jarvis.

  Core Features:

  Minimal, modern UI: A clean, high-tech feel with subtle animations or UI elements that enhance the experience without overwhelming the user.

  Voice Interaction: A simple microphone button that allows users to record their voice, which is then transcribed and sent to a webhook.

  Webhook Communication: The transcribed message is sent to a predefined webhook, and the webhook’s response is displayed back in the interface as Jarvis's reply.

  Sleek Display of Messages: Messages should appear in a chat-style format, distinguishing user messages from Jarvis’s responses.

  Dark Mode Aesthetic (preferred, but open to variations that fit a modern, AI-driven experience).

  Tech Preferences:

  Built with React (if possible) or another modern frontend framework

  Tailwind CSS for fast and clean styling

  Integration with ElevenLabs API for voice synthesis

  Webhooks to send and receive data

  The result should feel like a futuristic AI assistant interface—clean, intuitive, and efficient.

  No unnecessary clutter, just a smooth, engaging experience for interacting with Jarvis.

  No extra texts, just simply keep "J.A.R.V.I.S" in the top bottom in a futuristic font.”

* **3\. Embed the Eleven Labs Widget**:

  * Once you have the Eleven Labs embed code (obtained from the widget settings in Eleven Labs after configuring your agent), provide it to Lovable.dev.  
  * The embed code looks like this:   
    “\<elevenlabs-convai agent-id="agent\_01rlo0ffegnxf9waaj5tqhr7ey9p"\>\</elevenlabs-convai\>\<script src="https://unpkg.com/@elevenlabs/convai-widget-embed" async type="text/javascript"\>\</script\>”  
    You can get it from “Widget” section of the Eleven Labs Agents that you made  
  * Instruct Lovable.dev to embed this code into the app as the **main interface for conversational interaction**. This will display the Eleven Labs voice interface directly in your web application.  
      
* **4\. Iterative Refinement of the User Interface**:

  * **Continuously send more messages** to Lovable.dev to refine the design and functionality. This is a conversational process.  
  * **Adjust widget placement**: Request that the Eleven Labs widget be centered or placed according to your preference. Initially, the user had trouble centering it, but persistence or uploading screenshots helped.  
  * **Customize visual elements**:  
    * Change the default visual element from an "orb" to an **image** (e.g., an image of Jarvis).  
    * Modify displayed text, such as changing "start to call" to "talk to Jarvis".  
    * Adjust the size or layout, like setting it to "compact" mode. The user also successfully asked it to make the widget bigger later.  
    * Add dynamic elements, like a **pulsing logo** in the top left or "techy pulsing and dynamic elements in the background" for a modern feel. The system can interpret vague requirements like "techy pulsing" and implement them.  
  * **Remove unwanted features**: If the initial draft includes elements you don't want (e.g., a text messaging interface), explicitly tell Lovable.dev to remove them.  
  * **Provide screenshots (if necessary)**: If Lovable.dev is having trouble understanding a visual adjustment, you can upload images to show it what you mean.
